  "tagline": "Back to the Land",
  "body": "'Back To The Land' is an annual meet of families interested in moving back to the land and of those who have already taken the initial steps. This is the fourth consecutive year of this event. Since there is a felt need to deepen the dialogue for those who have taken the initial steps, we are attempting the first BTTL-Immersion.\r\n\r\nThis gathering is being held at the Marudam Farm School in Tiruvannamalai. This is a four day residential meet from the 8th to the 11th of December. We can accommodate only 100 participants including kids. For this reason, we request you to not forward or publicise this invite. \r\n\r\n---\r\n**__We request you to register only if you can commit to attending all the four days of the gathering, starting from the morning of the 8th to the noon of 11th__**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEvery day would have one or two scheduled discussions anchored by a panel of people experienced and knowledgeable in specific areas. The rest of the day will be planned every morning in an unconference style. There will be sufficient time to connect and interact with other participants throughout the day. Some of the themes we plan to explore are Community Living, Green Architecture, Education, Permaculture, Localisation, etc.\r\n\r\nWe are attemting to make the event children friendly. Marudam is a kid-friendly space with a lovely playground and lots of opportunity to engage in different forms of **arts, craft and play**. \r\n\r\n**Vegetarian Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner** will be provided at Marudam. We also plan to have some beverage and fruit during the day. If anyone in your family has any special dietary needs, please mention it in the registration form.  \r\nThe classrooms in Marudam are open for those who are ok with dormitory-style accommodation. If your family has special needs please mention it in the registration form and we will work out something appropriate.\r\n\r\n**Transportation:** We encourage participants to use public transportation as much as possible, and not drive down to Tiruvannamalai. We consider this as an important step in the journey towards sustainable living/world. We can arrange for a vehicle to transport people to and from the venue. Marudam community would strictly not like to have cars lined up in their parking lot during the three days.\r\n\r\nDetails of Marudam can be found at http://www.marudamfarmschool.org/\r\n\r\n**Registration:** BTTL has run on the principle of gift culture. We would like to ensure that for the right person, funds is not an obstacle. To cover the costs of set-up, basic accommodation and meals, we would suggest a participatory contribution of Rs 1000/- per adult (18 yrs and above) and Rs 500/- per young adult (12 to 17 yrs), with no charge for children (11 yrs and below). You can pay whatever is appropriate for your situation. If possible you are encouraged to sponsor someone else's participation. \r\n\r\nPlease register by clicking on this link: https://goo.gl/YEdmEm \r\nThank you!\r\n",
